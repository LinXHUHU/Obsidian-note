Technical Field of the Invention:

The invention operates within the technical field of data integrity protection mechanisms in communication systems, with a particular focus on optimizing End-to-End (E2E) verification processes. This technology is highly relevant in various industries where data transmission reliability and security are critical, including automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, and industrial automation.

Prior Art State:

In the prior art, particularly in the context of automotive communication systems, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data during transmission has been a significant concern. Traditional E2E mechanisms often involve multiple data copying operations as data packets traverse through different layers or components of the communication stack. While effective in verifying data integrity, these methods suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant data copying, leading to increased processing overhead and reduced system performance.

Various protocols, standards, and implementations have been developed to address these challenges, including those specified by organizations like Autosar (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) and industry standards such as ISO 26262 for functional safety in automotive systems. Additionally, research and development efforts have explored advanced cryptographic techniques, checksum algorithms, and error detection/correction methods to enhance the reliability and security of data transmission.

However, despite these advancements, the prior art often lacks efficient solutions to minimize the number of data copying operations during E2E verification, leading to suboptimal performance and resource utilization. This limitation underscores the need for innovative approaches to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data integrity protection mechanisms in communication systems, which the present invention aims to address.

Problem to be Solved and Improvement in Prior Art:

The problem to be solved in the prior art of End-to-End (E2E) data integrity protection mechanisms, particularly in the context of automotive communication systems, is the inefficiency caused by excessive data copying during the verification process. Traditional E2E mechanisms often involve multiple copies of data packets as they traverse through different layers or components of the communication stack, leading to increased processing overhead and reduced efficiency.

One of the significant defects of the prior art is the inherent inefficiency in data handling, particularly concerning the verification of data integrity. Each layer or component in the communication stack may perform its own copy of the data packet to compute checksums or perform integrity checks, resulting in redundant data copying operations that consume computational resources and degrade overall system performance.

The invention addresses this issue by introducing an improvement that reduces the number of data copying operations during the E2E verification process. By optimizing the implementation of E2E mechanisms, such as employing zero-copy techniques or minimizing unnecessary data transfers between different layers or components, the invention aims to enhance the efficiency of E2E data integrity protection while maintaining the same level of security and reliability.

Specifically, the proposed improvement seeks to minimize the overhead associated with data copying operations without compromising the integrity or security of the data. This can be achieved by optimizing the design and implementation of E2E mechanisms to eliminate redundant data copying and streamline the verification process, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving overall system efficiency.

In summary, the improvement introduced in the invention aims to address the inefficiencies and limitations of the prior art by reducing the number of data copying operations during the E2E verification process. By optimizing data handling techniques and minimizing unnecessary overhead, the invention enhances the efficiency and performance of E2E data integrity protection mechanisms in automotive communication systems.
