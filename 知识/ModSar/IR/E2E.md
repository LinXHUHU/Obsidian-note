Technical Field of the Invention:

The technical field of the invention pertains to data integrity protection mechanisms in communication systems, particularly in the context of automotive electronic systems. Specifically, it involves ensuring the integrity and reliability of data transmitted between different components or nodes within the automotive network. The purpose is to safeguard critical data as it travels from its source to its destination, thereby maintaining the functionality and safety of the overall automotive system.

Prior Art State:

In the realm of automotive electronics and communication systems, ensuring data integrity during transmission has been a longstanding concern. Traditional methods for data protection, such as error detection and correction codes, have been employed to address this issue. However, with the increasing complexity and connectivity of modern automotive networks, more sophisticated solutions are required to effectively mitigate the risks associated with data corruption, tampering, or interception.

One of the prominent technologies used in this domain is End-to-End (E2E) data integrity protection. E2E mechanisms employ cryptographic techniques, checksums, or other integrity verification methods to verify the authenticity and integrity of data packets from their source to their destination. These mechanisms provide a robust defense against various threats, including data manipulation, injection of malicious payloads, or unauthorized access.

The prior art in this field includes various protocols, standards, and implementations aimed at ensuring E2E data integrity in automotive communication networks. These may include protocols specified by organizations like Autosar (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) or industry standards such as ISO 26262 for functional safety in automotive systems. Additionally, research and development efforts from academia and industry have contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art in E2E data protection mechanisms tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of automotive applications.

Problem to be Solved and Improvement in Prior Art:

The problem to be solved in the prior art of End-to-End (E2E) data integrity protection mechanisms, particularly in the context of automotive communication systems, is the inefficiency caused by excessive data copying during the verification process. Traditional E2E mechanisms often involve multiple copies of data packets as they traverse through different layers or components of the communication stack, leading to increased processing overhead and reduced efficiency.

One of the significant defects of the prior art is the inherent inefficiency in data handling, particularly concerning the verification of data integrity. Each layer or component in the communication stack may perform its own copy of the data packet to compute checksums or perform integrity checks, resulting in redundant data copying operations that consume computational resources and degrade overall system performance.

The invention addresses this issue by introducing an improvement that reduces the number of data copying operations during the E2E verification process. By optimizing the implementation of E2E mechanisms, such as employing zero-copy techniques or minimizing unnecessary data transfers between different layers or components, the invention aims to enhance the efficiency of E2E data integrity protection while maintaining the same level of security and reliability.

Specifically, the proposed improvement seeks to minimize the overhead associated with data copying operations without compromising the integrity or security of the data. This can be achieved by optimizing the design and implementation of E2E mechanisms to eliminate redundant data copying and streamline the verification process, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving overall system efficiency.

In summary, the improvement introduced in the invention aims to address the inefficiencies and limitations of the prior art by reducing the number of data copying operations during the E2E verification process. By optimizing data handling techniques and minimizing unnecessary overhead, the invention enhances the efficiency and performance of E2E data integrity protection mechanisms in automotive communication systems.
