Technical Field of the Invention and Prior Art State:

The technical field of the invention pertains to communication systems and data distribution technologies, particularly in the context of automotive software architectures. In modern automotive systems, communication between various electronic control units (ECUs) is crucial for efficient and reliable operation. Traditional communication protocols and middleware solutions often face challenges in meeting the real-time and bandwidth requirements of automotive applications.

Prior art in this field includes various communication protocols and middleware solutions used in automotive systems, such as CAN (Controller Area Network), FlexRay, LIN (Local Interconnect Network), Ethernet, and different implementations of middleware like AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) Communication Stack. While these technologies have been widely adopted, they may encounter limitations in terms of scalability, real-time performance, or bandwidth efficiency, particularly in complex automotive systems with increasing demands for data exchange.

In recent years, advancements in communication technologies have led to the emergence of solutions like Fast DDS (Data Distribution Service), which offers high-performance, real-time data distribution suitable for automotive applications. Fast DDS leverages techniques such as zero-copy data transfer to enhance efficiency and minimize latency in communication between ECUs. This approach addresses some of the shortcomings of traditional middleware solutions, making it particularly promising for use in automotive software architectures.

The purpose of this invention is to further improve upon existing communication systems by integrating Fast DDS into a Component Communication (COM) module within the AUTOSAR framework, thereby harnessing its advantages including zero-copy data transfer, enhanced performance, and scalability. This invention aims to provide a more efficient and reliable communication solution for automotive systems, meeting the evolving requirements of modern vehicle architectures.
